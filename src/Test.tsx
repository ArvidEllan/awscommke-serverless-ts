          AWS Community Day is a dynamic event celebrating the AWS community,
          uniting cloud enthusiasts, developers, and professionals from diverse
          fields. This event highlights the expansive universe of AWS
          technologies, offering participants the chance to dive into
          educational sessions, engage in practical workshops, and expand their
          professional networks. Attendees will explore cutting-edge trends and
          practical applications of AWS services, fostering a collaborative
          environment rich in knowledge exchange and innovation. The event is
          designed to provide a platform for learning and sharing, with
          opportunities to gain insights from AWS experts and industry leaders.
          Join us to connect with peers, enhance your AWS skills, and become
          part of a thriving community driven by shared learning and growth. As
          GenAI models grow more complex, successfully optimizing their
          accuracy, cost efficiency, and deployment velocity on AWS becomes both
          increasingly critical and challenging. This session will provide an
          end-to-end guide for GenAI teams to maximize their workload efficiency
          on AWS. We’ll provide an overview of the full GenAI development
          lifecycle then do a deep dive into progressive model optimization
          techniques—from prompt engineering to RAG and fine tuning—exploring
          how each incrementally improves accuracy while minimizing retraining
          compute requirements. Shifting gears, we’ll share AWS best practices
          for optimizing GenAI model packaging, deployment, and inference using
          containers and hardware acceleration. Monitoring and maintaining
          production GenAI workloads presents its own challenges, which we’ll
          address through observability, data drift detection, and model
          degradation monitoring techniques and tools on AWS. Attendees will
          walk away with a clear framework for incrementally optimizing their
          GenAI workloads throughout the machine learning lifecycle with an eye
          toward maximizing performance while keeping costs in check.
